#Abundance transitions: Baranov

* For a single region, the numbers at age $a$ surviving, dying from fishing, and dying from other causes (e.g., $M$) over a unit time interval (e.g., 1 year) are $$N_{L,t+1,a} = N_{t,a} S_{t,a} = N_{t,a} e^{-Z_{t,a}}$$ $$N_{C,t+1} = N_{t,a} H_{t,a} = N_t \frac{F_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}}\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}}\right)$$ $$N_{K,t+1} = N_{t,a} D_{t,a} = N_t \frac{M_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}}\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}}\right).$$

---

#Abundance transitions: Baranov
* More generally, for an interval of length $\delta$: $$N_{L,t+\delta,a} = N_{t,a} S(t,\delta,a) = N_{t,a} e^{-Z_{t,a}\delta}$$
$$N_{C,t+\delta} = N_{t,a} H(t,\delta,a) = N_t \frac{F_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}}\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}\delta}\right)$$ $$N_{K,t+\delta} = N_{t,a} D(t,\delta,a) = N_t \frac{M_{t,a}}{Z_{t,a}}\left(1 - e^{-Z_{t,a}\delta}\right).$$
---

# Vector-Matrix form

* Define the vector of numbers at age $a$ at time $t$ that are alive, previously captured, and previously dead to to natural mortality: $$\mathbf{N}_{t,a} = (N_{L,t,a}', N_{C,t,a}', N_{K,t,a}')'$$ and the probability transition matrix: $$\mathbf{P}_{t,\delta,a} = \begin{bmatrix} S(t,\delta,a) & H(t,\delta,a) & D(t,\delta,a) \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\ \end{bmatrix}$$
* The abundance in each category at the end of the interval $\delta$ is $$\mathbf{N}_{t+\delta,a} =  \mathbf{P}_{t,\delta,a}' \mathbf{N}_{t,a}$$
* The probability transition matrix over multiple seasons (e.g., a year) is just the product of the seasonal matrices: $$\mathbf{P}_{t,\delta_1 + \delta_2,a} = \mathbf{P}_{t,\delta_1,a} \mathbf{P}_{t,\delta_2,a}$$
* If $t$ is the beginning of the year we typically set $N_{C,t,a}= 0$ to obtain cumulative catch over the yearly interval.

---

#Multiple regions

* When there are $n_R$ regions and $n_F$ fleets, the probability transition matrix is generalized to
$$\mathbf{P}_{t,\delta,a} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{O}(t,\delta,a) & \mathbf{H}(t,\delta,a) & \mathbf{D}(t,\delta,a) \\ 0 & \mathbf{I}_{H} & 0\\ 0 & 0 & \mathbf{1}_{D} \end{bmatrix}$$
$\mathbf{O}(t,\delta,a)$ is the $n_R \times n_R$ matrix defining survival and movement from one region (row) to another (column) over the interval $\delta$:
$$\mathbf{O}(t,\delta,a) =\begin{bmatrix} O_{1,1}(t,\delta,a) & \cdots & O_{1,n_R}(t,\delta,a) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ O_{n_R,1}(t,\delta,a) & \cdots & O_{n_R,n_R}(t,\delta,a) \end{bmatrix}$$
$\mathbf{H}(t,\delta,a)$ is the $n_R \times n_F$ matrix defining proportions captured in each fleet (column) given alive in each region (row) at the beginning of the interval:
$$\mathbf{H}(t,\delta,a) = \begin{bmatrix} H_{1,1}(t,\delta,a) & \cdots & H_{1,n_F}(t,\delta,a) \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ H_{n_R,1}(t,\delta,a) & \cdots & H_{n_R,n_F}(t,\delta,a) \end{bmatrix}$$
---

#Multiple regions

* Multi-WHAM currently assumes each fleet operates in a single region so each column of $\mathbf{H}(t,\delta,a)$ has at most 1 non-zero value.
* $\mathbf{D}(t,\delta,a)$ is $n_R \times 1$ in Multi-WHAM to minimize dimensions of $\mathbf{P}$, but could theoretically be $n_R \times n_R$ if tracking numbers dead due to natural mortality by region was of interest.
* Multi-WHAM can assume survival and movement processes are sequential or simultaneous within a seasonal interval.
  * For sequential survival occurs over the interval as usual and movement is assumed to happen instantly at the end of the interval:
$$\mathbf{O}(t,\delta,a) = \mathbf{S}(t,\delta,a)\boldsymbol{\mu}(t,\delta,a).$$
  * For simultaneous survival and movement, movement parameters are instantaneous rates like mortality. There is an infinitesimal matrix that is a function of the instantaneous rates which is exponentiated for the probability transition matrix: 
  $$\mathbf{P}_{t,\delta,a} = e^{\mathbf{A}_{t,\delta, a}\delta}$$
---

#Sequential survival and movement

* $\mathbf{S}$ is a diagonal matrix of proportions surviving in each region (given they start in that region):
    $$\mathbf{S}(t,\delta,a) = \begin{bmatrix} e^{-Z_1(t,\delta,a)} & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\ 0 & e^{-Z_2(t,\delta,a)} & \cdots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & \cdots & 0 & e^{-Z_R(t,\delta,a)} \end{bmatrix}$$
* $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is matrix of proportions moving from one region to another or staying (given they start in that region) 
$$\boldsymbol{\mu}(t,\delta,a) = \begin{bmatrix} 1-\sum_{r' \neq 1} \mu_{1\rightarrow r'} & \mu_{1\rightarrow 2} & \cdots & \mu_{1\rightarrow R} \\ \mu_{2\rightarrow 1} & 1-\sum_{r' \neq 2} \mu_{2\rightarrow r'} & \cdots & \mu_{2\rightarrow R} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \mu_{R\rightarrow 1} & \cdots & \mu_{R\rightarrow R-1} & 1-\sum_{r' \neq R} \mu_{R\rightarrow r'} \end{bmatrix}$$
The rows sum to 1 and each of the $\mu_{r\rightarrow r'}$ parameters may be year, age, and season-specific.

---

#Simultaneous survival and movement

* For the scenario where 1 fleet operates in each region the instantaneous rate matrix is
 $$\mathbf{A}_{t,\delta, a} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{1} & \mu_{1\rightarrow 2} & \cdots & \mu_{1\rightarrow R} & F_{t,a,1} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & M_{t,a,1} \\ \mu_{2\rightarrow 1} & a_{2} & \cdots & \mu_{2\rightarrow R} & 0 & F_{t,a,2} & \cdots & 0 & M_{t,a,2} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & 0 & \vdots \\ \mu_{R\rightarrow 1} & \cdots & \cdots & a_{R} & 0 & \cdots & 0 & F_{t,a,R} & M_{t,a,R} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix}.$$ where $a_{r} = -\left(\sum_{r' \neq r} \mu_{1\rightarrow r'} + F_{t,a,r} + M_{t,a,r}\right)$ (rows sum to 0).
* The component matrices $\mathbf{O}$, $\mathbf{H}$, and $\mathbf{D}$ are obtained from exponentiating $\mathbf{A}$. 
* This option is still considered experimental because it is currently computationally inefficient.

---

# Movement parameters

* There are at most $n_R-1$ parameters for each season $(i)$ and region $(r)$ for either the sequential or simultaneous configurations. 
* Movement parameters are estimated on a transformed scale. 
  * simultaneously: log scale
  * sequential: additive logit link transformation (like a multinomial regression)
* Age- and/or year-specific (1D or 2D AR1/iid) random effects are normally distributed on the transformed scale $$f(\mu_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a}) = \theta_{r \rightarrow r',i} + \epsilon_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a}$$ $$Cov\left(\epsilon_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a},\epsilon_{r \rightarrow r',i,y',a'}\right) = \frac{\rho_{r \rightarrow r',i,\mathcal{A}}^{|a-a'|}\rho_{r \rightarrow r',i,\mathcal{Y}}^{|y-y'|}\sigma^2_{r \rightarrow r',i}}{\left(1 - \rho_{r \rightarrow r',i,\mathcal{A}}^2\right)\left(1 - \rho_{r \rightarrow r',i,\mathcal{Y}}^2\right)}$$
* Mean, variance and correlation parameters for the random effects are season- and region-to-region-specfic.
* Covariate effects can be age-, season-, and/or region-to-region-specific: $$f(\mu_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a}) = \theta_{r \rightarrow r',i} + \sum^{n_E}_{k=1} \beta_{a,i,r \rightarrow r',k} E_k$$ and the same orthogonal polynomial options in the current version of WHAM are available. 
---

#Movement parameters
* Movement parameters can including both random and environmental effects: $$f(\mu_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a}) = \theta_{r \rightarrow r',i} + r_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a} + \sum^{n_E}_{k=1} \beta_{r \rightarrow r',i,k} E_{k,y}$$
* Multi-WHAM currently has no likelihood component for tagging observations, but priors can be configured from auxiliary movement parameter estimates. 
* When prior distributions are used, the (mean) movement parameters are random effects with the mean defined by the user-defined fixed effect counterpart and standard deviation $$\gamma_{r \rightarrow r',i} \sim \text{N}\left(\theta_{r \rightarrow r',i}, \sigma^2_{r \rightarrow r',i}\right)$$  and the transformed movement parameter is defined instead as $$f(\mu_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a}) = \gamma_{r \rightarrow r',i} + r_{r \rightarrow r',i,y,a} + \sum^{n_E}_{k=1} \beta_{r \rightarrow r',i,k} E_{k,y}$$.

---

#Natural mortality


When not estimated, (mean) mortality rates may be region-, and age-specific $\mu_{M,r,a}$. When age- and year-specific random effects $m_{r,y,a}$ are allowed, variance and correlation parameters can be region-specific. The options for each region are

* `none`: (default) No random effects by age or year.
* `iid_a`: uncorrelated M by age, constant in time.
* `iid_y`: uncorrelated M by year, constant all ages.
* `ar1_a`: M correlated by age (AR1), constant in time.
* `ar1_y`: M correlated by year (AR1), constant all ages.
* `iid_ay`: M uncorrelated by year and age (2D).
* `ar1_ay`: M correlated by year and age (2D AR1).

Any environmental covariate effects can be region- and age-specific. The general configuration of log natural mortality is $$\log\left( M_{r,y,a}\right) = \mu_{M,r,a} + m_{r,y,a} + \sum^{n_E}_{k=1} \beta_{r,a,k} E_{k,y}$$

---

#Initial Abundance at age

The options for parameterizing initial numbers at age have been expanded in Multi-WHAM:
* `age-specific`: $\log N_{1,r,a}$ are fixed effects. 
* `equilibrium`: $\log N_{1,r,1}$ (initial recruitment) and $\log F$ are fixed effects defining equilibrium numbers at age in the first year.
* `iid`: $\log N_{1,r,a} \sim \text{N}\left(\eta_{r},\sigma^2_{r}\right)$ are iid random effects.
* `ar1`: $\log N_{1,r,a} \sim \text{N}\left(\eta_{r},\frac{\sigma^2_{r}}{\left(1-\rho_{r}^2\right)}\right)$ are AR1 random effects.

---

#Equilibrium assumption

* Natural mortality and selectivity for fleet-specific fishing mortality at age are the same as those that occur during the first year of the model.
* With the assumption that each stock spawns in 1 region, there is only 1 $\log N_{1,r,1}$ parameter.
* The equilibrium calculations are essentially the same as those for SSB/R and Y/R calculations.
* The $n_R \times n_R$ equilibrium probability matrix of survival to age $a$ and being in each region is $$\widetilde {\mathbf{O}}_{a} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \prod^{a-1}_{i=0}\mathbf{O}_{i}  & 1\leq a<A\\ \left[\prod^{a-1}_{i=0}\mathbf{O}_{i}\right] \mathbf{O}_{+} & a = A \end{array} \right.$$ where $\mathbf{O}_{0} = {\bf I}$.
* $\mathbf{O}_{i}$ is the upper left survival and movement sub-matrix of the probability transition matrix for age $i$ as defined previously. For the plus group $a=A$, $\mathbf{O}_{+} = \left(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{O}_{A}\right)^{-1}$ is a "fundamental matrix" derived using the matrix generalization of the summation of a convergent geometric series. 
* Equilibrium abundance at age is $$N_{1,r,a} = N_{1,r} \widetilde {\mathbf{O}}_{a}(s_r,r)$$ where $s_r$ is the region of spawning and $\mathbf{O}(i,j)$ is the element in row $i$ and column $j$ of the matrix $\mathbf{O}$.

#Abundance at age transitions

* The numbers at age are vector analogs of the equations for numbers at age in the standard WHAM model  
* Options for configuring recruitment are the same as the standard WHAM package. 
* If recruitment is assumed to be a function of SSB, it is only the SSB in the spawning region at the time of spawning. 
* For ages $a = 2,...,A-1$, where $A$ is the plus group, The vector of numbers at age $a$ by region in year $y$ is $$\log\left(\mathbf{N}_{y,a}\right) =  \log\left(\mathbf{O}_{y-1,a-1}' \mathbf{N}_{y-1,a-1}\right) + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{y,a}$$ and for the plus group $$\log\left(\mathbf{N}_{y,A}\right) =  \log\left(\mathbf{O}_{y-1,A-1}' \mathbf{N}_{y-1,A-1} + \mathbf{O}_{y-1,A}' \mathbf{N}_{y-1,A}\right) + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{y,A}.$$
* The region-specific errors $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{y,a}$ are independent, but within regions, abundance at age have the same autoregressive options as the standard WHAM package. Generally, variance parameters can be region and age specific $\sigma_{r,a}$ and age and/or year AR1 correlation parameters can be region-specific $(\rho_{\mathcal{A},r}$, $\rho_{\mathcal{Y},r})$.
* "Survival" transitions can be deterministic $(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}_{y,a} = 0)$ as in traditional statistical catch at age models.

---

# Aggregate catch and index observations

* The likelihood equations for catch and index observations are the same as the standard WHAM package.
* The predicted catch is a function of the abundance at age of each stock and probabilities of capture in each fleet.
* The predicted catch biomass at age for fleet $f$:

$$\widehat{C}_{f,a,y} = \left(\sum^{n_S}_{s=1} \sum^{n_R}_{r=1} H_{s,a,y}(r,f) N_{s,r,a,y}\right) c_{f,a,y}.$$
For index $i$ the predicted index at age is 

$$\hat{I}_{a,y,i} = q_i s_{a,y,i} N_{a,y}W_{a,y,i} e^{-Z_{a,y}f_{y,i}}.$$

where $q_i$ is the catchability and $f_{y,i}$ is the fraction of the annual time step elapsed when the index is observed. There are options for indices to be in terms of abundance (numbers) or biomass and $W_{a,y,i} = 1$ for the former.

# Equilibrium per recruit calculations


The $n_r \times n_r$ matrix of equilibrium spawning stock biomass per recruit for stock $s$ in region $r'$ (columns) given recruiting in region $r$ (rows) is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ssbpr}
 \widetilde {\mathbf{O}}_s({\widetilde F}) = \sum^{A}_{a=1} \mathbf{O}_{s,a} \mathbf{O}_{s,a}(\delta_s) \text{diag}\left({\bf f}_{s,a}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{O}_{s,a}(\delta_s)$ is $n_r x n_r$ is the matrix of probabilities of surviving and occurring in region $r'$ at age $a+\delta_s$ given starting in region $r$ at age $a$. It is the upper left sub-matrix of the probability transition matrix defined over the same interval (eq. \ref{eq:ptm}). Similarly,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equilibrium.survival}
 \mathbf{O}_{s,a} = \left\{
 \begin{array}{ll}
\prod^{a-1}_{i=0}\mathbf{O}_{s,i}  & 1\leq a<A\\
\left[\prod^{a-1}_{i=0}\mathbf{O}_{s,i}\right] \mathbf{O}_{S,+} & a = A
 \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}
is the upper left sub-matrix of the probability transition matrix of states at age $a$ (columns) given being in each state (rows) at recruitment (age 1) where $\mathbf{O}_{s,0} = {\bf I}$. For the plus group $a=A$, $\mathbf{O}_{s,+} = \left(\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{O}_{s,A}\right)^{-1}$ is a ``fundamental matrix'' derived using the matrix version of the  geometric series [@kemenysnell60]. $\mathbf{f}_{s,a}$ is the vector of fecundities (product of weight and maturity) at age $a$ in each region.
