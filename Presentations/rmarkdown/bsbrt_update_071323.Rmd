#ASAP3 to (single stock) WHAM <br>

Starting with 2021 management track model inputs
* First fit ASAP3-like SCAA models (no random effects)

* Using the same indices? VAST for inshore indices?
* Index CVs are not based on designs 
  * will use any design-based estimates when asap3 inputs are updated.
* Effective sample sizes for any age composition observations have been adjusted 
  * using self-weighting likelihoods makes this a non-issue.

Confirm that results are similar to ASAP3 and that results are similar between single-stock and multi-stock wham.
1. Fit models for north and south separately in single-stock version of wham  
2. Fit models for north and south separately in multi-stock version of wham  
3. Fit model for north and south simultaneously in multi-stock wham (no migration)

#Simplify North and South

* When combining the stocks, there would be 17 indices and 4 fleets with 25 selectivity models (blocks)
  * when moving to random effects, the estimation of these parameters change which can cause convergence issues or other parameterizations to become more appropriate
* When moving to movement models, estimating initial numbers at age in each region for each stock can be difficult
* **Doing further explorations with slimmed down data and model configurations**
  * just the Bigelow, Albatross, and Rec CPA indices
  * equilibrium assumption for initial numbers at age

Currently:
* All Jan 1 recruitment for a given stock only in respective regions
* All North fish move back to their spawning region at end of season 5
* All North fish remain in spawning region until end of season 7
* Spawning season is only time when whole North population is in spawning region
* South population is only in South.

---

#Movement hypothesis 1
1. Fit model with assumed movement prob = 0.1 both north to south and south to north (done)
2. Fit model with prior on movement (mean = 0.1, sd = 0.5?) (not done)
  * movement probabilities can be different from north to south and south to north 
3. Fit model with yearly RE on movement. (not done)
4. Fit model with covariate effects and yearly RE. (not done)
